        <h2 class="main">Music Bio</h2>
        <p class="meow">I like to listen to indie music. It brings me some sense of
            peace and tranquility. It also evokes inspiration for me sometimes. Whenever
            I am listening to a song I would either vibe with the song, daydream little
            scenarios as if I'm in a edit or whoever else I may imagine. This would all
            depend on the flow and feel of the song.

    <article id="emotions" class="aesthetic">
        <h2>Aesthetic emotions</h2>
        <p> Usually for indie music at least the type I hear it would be usually romantic,
            dreamy, sad, chill. That's how I intepret it anyways. I like the overall feel
            and Aesthetic it brings whenevr I listen to it. The feeling or overall emotion
            is brung out by the lyrics
        </p>

    <div class="Resonate">
        <h2>Resonating</h2>
        <p class="last"> These songs are the select few of many that I would listen to of course.
            They give a <i>perfect</i> example on how different the emotions and feelings can be portrayed
            in this genre. They resonate with me deeply depending on the mood, wether that would be
            to uplift me or if I want to relax. That's why I like to listen to this genre, but I can
            also say others could agree to this statement with their preferred one.
